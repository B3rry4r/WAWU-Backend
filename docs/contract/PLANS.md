# The maker plan: prices, tiers and the billing currency

Task TIER-01, 8 Oct 2026 (R-43, R-44). How the plan's figures are kept, how a
person's billing currency is decided and fixed, and what `GET /plans` and
`GET /me/tier` answer. The money routes' own rules are in
[`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md); this page adds what a second currency
needs.

## 1. One config file

Every price, product count, points amount, expiry, cost and cap of the
owner's 5 Oct plan (Developer Brief v2.0, section 2) is in
`src/plans/plans.config.json`, and nowhere else. The figures in it are the
owner's example values until the owner sends final prices (R-43): the file's
`provisional` object and the `PROVISIONAL(...)` markers in
`src/plans/plans-config.ts` say so, one per value (`PLAN-PRICES` for the whole
file; `PLAN-CASHOUT-MINIMUM` and `PLAN-BOUGHT-POINTS-DAYS`, the two values the
brief does not give; `PLAN-ENDING-DAYS`, VF14's window). A spec keeps the two
lists equal.

- **Units.** Money is whole minor units: `kobo` for people billed in naira,
  `cents` for people billed in dollars (`"price": { "kobo": ..., "cents":
  ... }`). The brief writes naira and dollars; each figure here is the brief's
  times 100. Points are whole points; a pack and the checkout offer give a
  different number of points per currency (`"points": { "NGN": ..., "USD":
  ... }`).
- **Checked at boot.** The server reads the file once when it starts
  (`PLANS_CONFIG`, a provider of `PlansModule`) and checks all of it: a file
  that is not JSON, or a field that is missing, unknown (a misspelling), of
  the wrong kind or out of range, stops the server with
  `plans.config.json: <field> <problem>. Fix the file and restart.`, for
  example `tiers[1].price.kobo must be a whole number of 1 or more (it is
  3000.5)`. A key written twice in one object stops it too
  (`tiers[0].price.kobo is written twice`: `JSON.parse` would keep the
  second). No whole number may exceed 2,147,483,647, the most an INTEGER
  column holds (counts and points are copied into such columns), and
  `action_points` must price exactly the brief's twelve actions. Ids must be
  unique; a tier's `event_pass` must be listed in
  `event_passes`; `preselected_tier` and every key of `referral.base_points`
  must name a tier; referral levels and milestones must rise.
- **Changing a figure** is editing the file and restarting (a deploy rsyncs
  the source, so the server reads the new file). No code changes.
- **Nothing else writes a figure.** `src/plans/tests/plans-figures.spec.ts`
  fails when a number from the config is written as a literal in the plan's
  code (`src/plans/`, and any folder a later task adds to
  `FIGURE_FREE_DIRS`), or when any string in `src/` writes a plan price as
  money (`₦` or `$`) or a plan points amount as points.

## 2. The billing currency

A person is billed in `NGN` or `USD` (the `BillingCurrency` enum).

1. Once fixed, the fixed one (`PersonBilling`, one row per person).
2. Not fixed yet: `NGN` for a person with a naira wallet (a `FintavaWallet`
   row, the table the wallet gate reads).
3. Otherwise the country code the token's `phone` is written with: `+234`
   (also `00234`, or `234` and ten digits) is `NGN`, any other code is `USD`.
4. A phone with no country code (`0803...`, `(803) 555-0100`), no phone, or a
   `phone` claim that is not text: the token's `country` claim decides
   (`Nigeria`, `NG` or `NGA`, any case, is `NGN`; anything else or nothing is
   `USD`). Lead ruling N1, 8 Oct 2026: WAWU ID's web sign-up keeps the phone
   as typed and the dial code apart, so ten local digits cannot be read as
   Nigerian on their own.

**Fixed at the first purchase, never changed by a route.**
`BillingCurrencyService.fixAtFirstPurchase({ wawuUserId, phone, country,
purchaseRef }, tx)` is called by the purchase (TIER-03; POINTS-02 for a first purchase of
points) inside the transaction that records it. It inserts only when there is
no row (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and answers the currency that holds, so a
repeated confirmation or two first purchases at once leave one currency, and a
purchase that rolls back fixes nothing. The purchase prices in the currency it
answers. Run it at READ COMMITTED (what every transaction in `src/` uses): at
REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE the losers of a race get Prisma `P2034`
instead, and the purchase must then be retried. No method and no route updates the row (a spec checks every write to
the table in `src/`); the owner's rule is "do not switch without support",
which is a person at WAWU changing it by hand, recorded as `fixedBy:
support`.

## 3. `GET /plans`

Signed in, `Cache-Control: no-store` (the answer is the caller's own). The plan in the caller's billing currency only: `currency`,
`currencyFixed`, `tiers`, `extraProducts`, `packs`, `checkoutBump`, `actions`
and `caps`. Every amount is `priceMinor`: whole minor units of `currency`
(kobo for `NGN`, cents for `USD`). The answer never holds the other
currency's figures: one price per item, picked by `priceIn` in
`plans-config.ts`. `tiers[].preselected` marks the tier VF5 shows selected
(Founding Maker in the example file). Referral and cash-out figures are in
the config for REF-01 and POINTS-04 and are not in this answer.

## 4. `GET /me/tier` (VF14)

Signed in, the caller's own only, `Cache-Control: no-store`. In the contract
`tier`, `eventPass` and `tier.badge` are `allOf` + `nullable` (they answer
null), and every number in both answers is `integer`
(`scripts/enrich-contract.js`, `src/plans` in both of its folder lists;
`plans-contract-shape.spec.ts` checks). `state` is:

| state | when |
|---|---|
| `none` | no tier was ever bought (no `MakerTier` row) |
| `active` | `activeUntil` is more than `tier_ending_days` days away |
| `ending` | still active, ending within `tier_ending_days` days |
| `ended` | `activeUntil` has passed; published products stay up, new publishing waits for a renewal (TIER-02) |

With `tier` (`id`, and `name` and `badge` from the config; both null if the
config no longer names that tier), `activeFrom`, `activeUntil`,
`productsAllowed` (the tier's products when bought plus `extraProducts`),
`pointsIncluded`, `firstVoiceIntroIncluded` and `eventPass` (the highest pass
the person holds, in the order of the config's `event_passes`).

## 5. What the tables hold

| Table | One row per | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `PersonBilling` | person, once their currency is fixed | `fixAtFirstPurchase` (TIER-03) |
| `MakerTier` | person who ever held a tier | TIER-03 (buy, renew, upgrade), TIER-04 (extra products) |
| `EventPass` | purchase that issued a pass (`purchaseRef` unique) | TIER-03 |

`MakerTier` copies what the tier gave when it was bought
(`productsIncluded`, `pointsIncluded`), so a later change to the config never
takes away what a person paid for. `MakerTierService` is the one reader: GET
/me/tier, the publishing gate (TIER-02, `hasActiveTier`) and the purchases ask
it. All three tables are in the account purge (OWNED) and the data export
(without payment references).
